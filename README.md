The same, but better (aka not a scam)


Project stages:

* Stage 1: Main Pseudo code (5m ish)
* Stage 2: Actual coding (25-30 minutes, possibly more since I'm behind on Attack on Titan)
* Stage 3: UI coding (hour or so?)

This program is free and open source. Feel free to download and modify. Please do not put up for sale.
